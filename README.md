# parallel-computing-using-MPI-openMP-and-CUDA

class notes from https://github.com/EricDarve/cme213-spring-2021

1. hw1 usage of cpp libaries: algorithm, functional, numeric STL functions
2. hw2 implementation of Radix Sort using OpenMP
3. hw3 a. Mandelbrot Set and PageRank using CUDA
4. hw4. solving heat equation PDE using Finite difference method. Use CUDA and shared memory to parallize it. 
5. Final Project, implement Neural Network from scratch. Split data into 4 different nodes, each nodes will split to their own GPU
